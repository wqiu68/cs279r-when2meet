To open the web app, download the repository and open in VS Code. Run `npm install` to install the necessary packages. Change into the when2meet directory by running the command `cd when2meet` in the terminal. To run the app, run `npm start` and follow the link to `localhost:3000`.

Users can see the dates and times that are offered on the grid and are able to click on the boxes or click and drag across to toggle availability.  Boxes that are green represent available and grey means unavailable. Additionally, the user can see which boxes their mouse is hovering over in the light green color. After pressing the submit button, the user receives confirmation that their availability is saved.

Key characteristics that differentiate Doodle from When2meet is that Doodle has clicking checkbox options while When2meet is click and drag on a grid. Our implementation succesfully follows When2meet by letting users click and drag across the grid that represents times across several dates.
